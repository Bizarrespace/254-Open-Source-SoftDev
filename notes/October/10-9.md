*  Look at what git remote is, at first we had a http remote, but we want to do it with ssh instead, so we got to remove the remote and then re add it
*  git remote rm origin
*  Then git add origina "Ssh link"
*  Then git push origin Main branch that you made that then will add the local branch and replace the origin branch
*  For lab 7 just have the SSH link
