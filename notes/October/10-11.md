# Git and Github
* global, system, project level
* WorkFlow
  * Make directory
  * git init to make git
  * make a txt file with echo
  * git status to check on progress of the workign tree
  * git add to move to staging area
  * git commit -m "commit message"
    * Makes a screenshot of the current directory
  * Append a line to same file
    * This will make the txt file modified, therefore you would need to add and commit it again
    * If you dont want to commit, do git restore fileName, this takes the file back to its last committed state
      * This only works if the file is not staged
      * if state you would have to pass in a commit hash to take it back to that area (THINK)
  * git log
    * To see commit log
* Moving on to remotes
  * go to github
  * make a new repository, DONT ADD README
  * git remote add origin "shh url"
    * origin can be named anything
  * git remote to see remotes
  * Branch
    * Each commit has its own hash
    * Divers when master it on another commit, and your branch on a different commit
    * git branch -M main
      * Makes a new main branch
      * git branch to show all the branches
      * git push origin main
        * This pushes your main branch to the origin branch from the github respoitory
    * git checkout branch1
      * This changes your current branch to branch1
      * Make a new file with echo
        * git add . to add that new file onto the staging area
        * git commit -m "New File" to commit that file to the branch
        * git push origin branch1 to push that branch to the remote repository
          * On github now you would have two branches
  * Merging
    * Pull request:
      * In github do a pull request, and select the two different branches
        * Leave a comment, and then create a pull request
        * If no conflicts, easy merge pull
        * If conflicts:
          * Have to choose which code to merge into the main branch, cant do both at the same time because they are changing the same thing
        * Need permissions to merge
  * Git pull
    * git pull origin main
      * Pulls the changes from remote to your local respository
  * Going to a specific commit
    * git checkout "hashCode"
      * Then you are able to make a new branch, make changes from that commit, and then merge that branch to your main branch
