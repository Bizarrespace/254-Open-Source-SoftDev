# Lecture 4
**Operating Vi**
* Two modes, command and insert mode
  * Command mode is where each letter is a different command, i is to enter insert mode
  * Insert mode is where you can type into the file you are working with, esc to exit insert mode
* :x to quit and save
* can also do :wq

**Function arguments?** 
* echo "ehllo from $1" know what this means

**Data for lab 4 phone book**
* Stores to file
  * touch to make fiele
  * use condition to see if file exists\
* shell scripting assignment using sh 

```
#!/bin/bash
nameFile="Phonebook.txt"
if [-a $nameFile];
then 
echo "File exists" 
else 
echo "File does not exist"
touch phonebook.txt
fi
```

Then do ./checkFile.sh to run the code

# What needs to be done by wed
* make a shell script so that we can do phonebook new <name> <number>, ./phonebook list (cat fileName)
  * Using $1 to check for the first arugment
* check to see if the phonebook already exists, if not touch, if so check for the arugment given, if new add, if list then cat phonebook.txt, do ./phonebook clear as well by just using rm
* Figure out command that allows you to find stuff based on the description name, grep | user? Find in the tutorial
* Use the -k argument with man to look through the name section of the man pages
    * man -k user; this gives you everything in the name section that has the words user in it
 
**grep** 
* grep | user, this would be wrong due to how grep needs to take something, like where to look, and then what to look for
* cat joke1 joke2 | grep rabbit
  * This takes the two files, joke1 and joke 2 and then puts it into grep, and then we are looking for rabbit
  

* Quiz wed, lab 3, week 3
* Shell scripting
* Mid term next wed
